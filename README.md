# javascript-challenge

In this assignment, I was tasked with writing code that dynamically creates a table based upon a provided dataset. It also allows users to filter the table data for specific values using only pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on the web pages.

Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)

Along with the index.html file provided, and using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I wrote code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. The table includes columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.

I used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)


Complete all of Level 1 criteria.


Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
